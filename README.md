# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Analysis-with-SQL-Power-BI-Dashboards
I'm excited to share my latest project, where I utilized SQL and Power BI to analyze and visualize coffee shop sales data. This project allowed me to deep dive into data transformation, business requirement queries, and creating dynamic dashboards. Here's a glimpse of what I worked on:

SQL Analysis: 🔍 Data Transformation: Converted and formatted transaction dates and times for precise analysis. 📊 Business Queries: Executed various SQL queries to calculate month-over-month sales, total orders, and top products.

Power BI Dashboard: 📅 Date Table: Created a custom date table for accurate time-based analysis. 📈 Sales Analysis: Developed DAX measures for total sales, month-on-month growth, and dynamic visual comparisons. 🔥 Calendar Heat Map: Visualized daily sales trends with a calendar heat map. 🍩 Sales by Day: Analyzed sales by weekdays and weekends using a donut chart.

These tasks enhanced my skills in SQL, DAX, and data visualization, helping me draw actionable insights from raw data.
